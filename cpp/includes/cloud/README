low level socket stuff goes in here.
Asynchronous I/O sockets, ala-boost, are currently the only option. 
They use HTTP headers, in order to communicate with the HOP framework.

TODO:

Near future work, could also see the usage of blocking (non-asynchronous) sockets if needed.

Future work, could also see the usage of streaming sockets (UDP) for video or audio services which
need a lot of bandwidth, and where packet loss is not crucial.
