This is work in progress.

Currently, src contains all headers and source files, and tests includes examples which also perform simple tests.

NOTE:
    src/faceDetector/faceDetector.cpp requires some work from CERTH/ITI, as I do not yet know the JSON format that will be obtained by the server.
    If you want to know where your response should be, check under rapp-server/TCPConnection/TCPConnection.cpp
